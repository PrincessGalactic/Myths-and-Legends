    <h2>Greek and Roman Mythology</h2>
    
    <h3>Greek Mythology</h3>
    
    <p>When you think of Greek Mythology, you probably think of Greek Gods, or if you are <br>
      like me, you will think of Percy Jackson (mainly the book series written by Rick Riordon). <br>
      However, it isn't simply just Gods and Goddesses, there are so many more creatures and stories <br>
      that refer to Greek Mythology. <br>
      On this page, I will be listing all the Greek Gods and Goddesses, along with all the creatures <br>
      and stories that come with Greek Mythology. </p>
